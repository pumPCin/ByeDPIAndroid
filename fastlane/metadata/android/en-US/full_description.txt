<p><i>ByeDPI</i> runs a local VPN service to bypass DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) and censorship. It runs a SOCKS5 proxy <a href='https://github.com/hufrea/byedpi' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>ByeDPI</a> and redirects all traffic through it.</p><p>To bypass some blocks, you may need to change the settings. More about the various settings can be found in the <a href='https://github.com/hufrea/byedpi/blob/main/README.md' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>ByeDPI documentation</a>.</p><p>The application uses the VPN mode on Android to redirect traffic, but does not send anything to a remote server. It does not encrypt traffic and does not hide your IP address.</p>
